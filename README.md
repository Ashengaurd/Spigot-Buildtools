**Important:** This is a resource only for windows and is not compatible with other operating systems.  
Also, this is just an executor that will allow you multi-thread building for all available versions.

# BuildTools - Windows Installer
Most developers will need the "BuildTools" to access NMS for their plugins which is available here. But Installing it is a bit tricky and time-consuming. So I decided to make a program to do it for me while I was enjoying the process, I posted a screenshot on Spigot Discord and some people liked it so I decided to improve it and post it here to everyone use it if they want.

This is not sth different than the official build tools, It just runs the "BuildTools" which is included in this program too.

## Features

   * Multi-Thread with a customizable amount of workers
   * Craft Bukkit and Spigot build
   * Network Meter
   * Per worker Log
   * Cache Cleaner

## The tutorial

    Open 'BTI.exe' (BTI stands for BuildToolsInstaller)
    Check any version you like to install.
    If you don't want Craft Bukkit for 1.14+ Uncheck the Craft Bukkit on the right. (BuildTools will install Craft Bukkit for 1.13 and below)
    Click on 'Queue Versions' and just wait for Workers to pick them and build them for you.
    When a worker finishes the build it will clean most of the cache and report it back and look for a new version.
